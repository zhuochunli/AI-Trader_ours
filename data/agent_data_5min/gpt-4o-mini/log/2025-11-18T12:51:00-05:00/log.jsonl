The current position at $598.37 provides a suitable entry to short, allowing for a healthy risk-reward setup with the stop loss placed just above resistance.\n\n### Current Positions Update\nPrevious cash position: $428.72\nExisting QQQ shares: 16\n- **After entering the short position**: As this is a simulation, no shares are currently marked for sale, and we will proceed by recording the potential entry on the short trade as suggested above.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
