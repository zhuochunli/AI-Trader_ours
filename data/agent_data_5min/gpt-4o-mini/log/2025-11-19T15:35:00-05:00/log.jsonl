The stop loss at $599.50 provides a buffer against volatility should price retrace unexpectedly.\n\nNext, I will place the trade for QQQ. \n\n#### Initial Balances\n- Current cash: $391.33\n- Current position: 16 QQQ (from yesterday)\n\nHowever, the cash available is not enough to place additional orders considering you're looking to be long if needed. Since volatility is significant and cash is inadequate, I suggest staying flat for the moment.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
