Currently, we can't enter a new long position without increasing cash.\n\n**Final Decision**: Stay flat as no trading opportunity matches the liquidity available under the current conditions.\n\n### Summary\n- **Current Position**: Holding 16 shares of QQQ.\n- **Available Cash**: $407.72\n- **Market Status**: Bullish trend but unable to execute further trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
