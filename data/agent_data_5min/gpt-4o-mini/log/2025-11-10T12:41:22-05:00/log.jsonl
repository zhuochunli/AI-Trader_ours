However, given the current decline in momentum, I recommend caution.\n- **Sell Scenario**: If the price drops below $269, it might be wise to consider taking profits or limiting exposure by selling a portion of the holdings.\n- **Hold Scenario**: If the price stabilizes around the current range and shows signs of bouncing back with confirmation in volume, holding may be advisable.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will place a hold on my current position. If a sell or buy signal arises later based on confirmation of price action, I will act accordingly.\n\nSince no immediate trades are required, I will output the final signal.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
