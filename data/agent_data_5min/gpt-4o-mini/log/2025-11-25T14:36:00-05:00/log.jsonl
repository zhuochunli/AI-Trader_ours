Given available cash is $426.13, I will calculate the maximum shares I can buy.\n\n**Position Size Calculation:**\n- Current Price: $606.29\n- Maximum Shares to Buy = Available Cash / Entry Price = $426.13 / $606.29 ≈ 0.7 shares\n\nSince fractional shares cannot be bought, I’ll proceed with buying 0 shares.\n\n### Rationale\nThe rationale behind this trade is based on the observation that QQQ is in a strong bullish trend supported by significant volume and price action maintaining higher highs and higher lows. The potential for growth seems favorable given current market conditions, so the expected bounce back from the stop-loss level provides a decent risk-reward ratio with a target of $610. \n\nGiven the inability to buy shares with current cash levels, I will not execute a trade. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
