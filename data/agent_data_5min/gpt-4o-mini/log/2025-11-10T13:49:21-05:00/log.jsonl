Without strong bullish confirmation, buying more shares could be risky.\n\n3. **Selling Shares**:\n   - If expecting further downward movement, selling might be a strategic move to capitalize on the current higher price relative to historical prices.\n\n### Recommendation\nConsidering these factors and to align with risk management practices, the optimal strategy would be to **hold the current position** unless a favorable trading opportunity presents itself or further confirmation of bullish momentum occurs. \n\nI recommend monitoring the situation closely in the next few minutes to determine if buying or selling becomes advantageous.\n\nAs there are no actions defined to take at this moment, I will output <FINISH_SIGNAL>. \n\nIf you wish to execute a transaction immediately based on this analysis, please specify an action, either buy or sell, and the number of shares. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
