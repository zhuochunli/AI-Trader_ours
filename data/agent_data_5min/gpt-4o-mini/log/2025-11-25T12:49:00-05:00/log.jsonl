The available cash is only $169.39.\n\n### Revised Trade Strategy\nGiven the constraints of cash availability, I recommend adjusting the position strategy:\n\n- **Direction**: Stay Flat\n- **Rationale**: Due to the limited available capital, it's prudent to refrain from entering a long position that cannot be adequately supported by available cash. Taking a position without sufficient margin may lead to unintended financial consequences or inability to adhere to stop loss strategies. \n\nI recommend monitoring the stock for the rest of the day as conditions change, and there could be future opportunities. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
