A break above resistance may indicate a stronger bullish trend.\n- **Exit Strategy**: Be prepared to sell shares if there is a significant price drop below the support level or if you reach your profit target near $608.\n\nClose all positions prior to the end of today’s trading session as per guidelines.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like me to assist with or execute a sale operation. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
