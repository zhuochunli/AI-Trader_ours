Here are the updated positions:\n\n### Current Positions:\n- **QQQ**: 4 shares\n- **CASH**: $17,547.05\n\n### Summary of the Trade:\n- **Trade Direction**: Long\n- **Entry Price**: $611.10\n- **Stop Loss Price**: $609.80\n- **Take Profit Price**: $614.00\n\n### Rationale\n- The entry was based on the rebound off the identified support level of ~$611.00. The stop loss is set just below this level to protect against a breakout to the downside. The take profit level aims for a reasonable return if the price moves back towards its previous highs. \n\nI will monitor the market closely for any changes in trend or volatility. If conditions change significantly, I will reevaluate the position as necessary. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
