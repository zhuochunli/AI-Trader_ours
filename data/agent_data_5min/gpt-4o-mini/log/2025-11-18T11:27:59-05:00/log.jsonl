Given that, I will need to initiate a buy position first before being able to execute a short.\n\n### Revised Consideration\nSince I cannot sell short without an existing position, I'll switch to a long position if the market shows signs of potential recovery, or remain flat if the conditions still seem bearish based on the price action observed.\n\nHowever, considering the current downtrend and lack of sufficient cash or shares to perform a short, the best action would be to remain flat until further opportunities arise.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsidering the lack of available cash and current market conditions, the best action now is to **stay flat.** I will monitor for further signals which might provide a better opportunity to enter a position. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
