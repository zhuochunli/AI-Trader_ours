The accumulation of volume on certain price levels suggests potential support around $604.00.\n- **Potential Breakouts**: A breakout could occur if the stock moves convincingly above $605.00, which previously served as a resistance point. Conversely, if it falls below $603.00, a downside breakout could signal further bearish movement.\n- **Mean-Reversion Setups**: As QQQ trades closer to the recent low of approximately $600.00, there may be mean-reversion setups near $604.00 if buying pressure increases.\n\n### Step 3: Suggested Trade\n\n**Trade Position**: Long  \n- **Entry Price**: $604.05  \n- **Stop Loss Price**: $603.00  \n- **Take Profit Price**: $606.00  \n\n### Step 4: Rationale\n\nThis trade is based on the observation that QQQ is at a potential support level around $604.00. The price has displayed previous buying interest at this level. A confirmation of the uptrend is expected if it can clear the recent resistance around $605.00. The stop loss is set to protect against a break down below support, and the profit target is set to align with the recent high levels observed.\n\nI will proceed to execute this trade. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
