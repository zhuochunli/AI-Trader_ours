However, you can only buy up to 0 shares because you need to maintain enough cash for transaction costs.\n   - Selling: If you wish to sell some shares, you could consider selling at the current high or making strategic sell-offs near the resistance level.\n\nGiven that the market is currently trending upwards and that you have cash limitations for buying more shares, let's evaluate if you should hold your current position or sell some shares. Since there is considerable upward momentum and trading volume suggests bullish sentiment, it might be prudent to hold your current position.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nKeep your current position of 36 shares of AAPL for now. Monitor the stock closely for any strong resistance confirmation around the $273 level.\n\nNow let's check if there is a need to record this decision or update positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
