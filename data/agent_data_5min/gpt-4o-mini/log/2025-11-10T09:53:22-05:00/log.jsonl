Without this data, I am unable to effectively analyze the 5-minute bars or determine any trading patterns, specifically from yesterday or today.\n\nGiven the situation, here are the immediate conclusions:\n1. **No yesterday's data**: I cannot compare today's performance with yesterday's closing prices or trends.\n2. **Volume Analysis** (based on the available 5-minute data):\n   - The recent trading volume varies across the bars, with the highest volume recorded at 27,907 in the 14:35 bar.\n   - The price has shown a gradual increase from $269.13 to $273.57, indicating a bullish trend in the shorter timeframe.\n3. **Current Position**: You currently hold 36 shares of AAPL and have $212.38 in cash.\n\nWith no additional data available, the optimal action remains uncertain. Since the current trading price of AAPL is $273.575, and if looking at potential options:\n- **Assessing a Buy**: You have available cash but need to evaluate further unless you aim to lock in the current trend.\n- **Hold Recommendation**: Holding the current position may be advisable unless more favorable conditions arise.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to take a specific action such as buying more shares or if you want to proceed with another request. \n\nIf you have any further instructions or wish to continue analysis at a later stage, please let me know! \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
