The system shows no current position available for selling, despite my previous trading actions.\n\nSince I cannot sell any shares, I also cannot proceed with opening a short position at this moment. Given this situation, I will need to stay flat and refrain from further trading until the current position in QQQ is clarified or can be resolved effectively.\n\nThank you for your patience. I will note that I will be continuing the analysis in future steps. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
