AAPL experienced a significant drop from $272.69 at 15:10 to its current value around $269.44.\n   - The price is currently below the highs of the late morning session, indicating the potential for further decline.\n\n4. **Current Portfolio Positions:**\n   - You hold 8 shares of AAPL and have $7,866.77 in available cash.\n   - The current scenario may require a decision to buy more shares at a lower price, hold existing shares, or prepare to cut losses if the downtrend continues.\n\n5. **Support and Resistance Levels:**\n   - From the provided data, there seem to be some levels to watch:\n     - Immediate support around $268.00 from previous lows.\n     - Resistance observed above $272.00 from earlier highs during trading.\n\n6. **Decision Making:**\n   - Since the price is currently declining and showing bearish momentum, it might be wise to hold current positions while observing for signs of potential reversal.\n   - However, if the price drops below the $268.00 support level, it may be advisable to consider selling a portion of your holdings to limit potential losses.\n\nGiven this analysis, the current optimal position adjustment would be **to hold your existing AAPL shares** and monitor price action closely. If the price breaks below $268.00, consider selling part of your position.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to execute any buy or sell transactions based on this analysis, or if further analysis is needed.
