{"signature": "gpt-4o-mini", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that I made an error in determining the number of shares to buy given the available cash. The available cash is approximately $426.13, which means that I can only purchase a maximum of 0 shares based on the intended entry price of $607. With this cash amount, buying shares is not feasible since each share costs more than the cash available.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis and current positions:\n- The trade for QQQ cannot be executed due to insufficient funds to meet the entry price for a long position.\n- I'll remain flat on positions and suggest monitoring the market for potential entry when there are enough funds or price adjustments.\n\nIf further action or an additional analysis is required, please let me know! \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
