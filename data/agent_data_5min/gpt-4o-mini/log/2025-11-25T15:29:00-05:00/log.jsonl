Entering a long position at $608.10 allows us to capitalize on this breakout potential, while a stop loss at $606.50 protects us from significant losses should the price reverse.\n\nI will monitor this position until the market closes, ensuring that all positions are closed before the end of the trading day.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
