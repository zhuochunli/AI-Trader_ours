{"signature": "gpt-4o-mini", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems that I encountered an issue with executing the trade due to insufficient cash. The required cash for buying 6 shares of QQQ at the entry price of approximately $600.40 is significantly higher than the available cash of $408.70. \n\n### Adjusted Trading Plan\nSince I cannot proceed with the trade under the current conditions, I will remain flat to avoid any unnecessary risks. Given the current market structure, it is prudent to analyze further before making any commitments. \n\n#### Summary\n- **Current Position:** Flat\n- **QQQ Holding:** 16 shares\n- **Available Cash:** $408.70\n- **Current Price of QQQ:** ~$600.30\n\n### Recommendation\n- Monitor the price closely around the $600 level for potential re-entry or adjustments. \n- If the price breaks decisively above $601 with increased volume, consider a smaller position to maximize the potential profit while accounting for limited capital.\n\nFor now, it would be best to observe the market conditions before making any further moves.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
