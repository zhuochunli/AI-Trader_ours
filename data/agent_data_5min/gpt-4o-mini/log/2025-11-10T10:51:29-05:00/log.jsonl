The price is currently not at its peak for a sell-off.\n\n### Position Adjustment Recommendations:\nGiven the bullish price action, strong recent volume, and a positive momentum bias, I recommend holding the current position unless a significant upward movement triggers a buy or a sell due to risk management.\n\nI will proceed with:\n- **No immediate action** to change the number of shares held at this moment.\n\nAfter reviewing the analysis steps and considering the market conditions, I believe it is best to maintain the current holding and monitor the situation closely. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
