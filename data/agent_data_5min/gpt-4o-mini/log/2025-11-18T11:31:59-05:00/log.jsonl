Since I currently have 0 shares, I cannot execute a short trade directly.\n\n### Updated Plan\nIn light of this, I recommend pausing to see if there are any further developments in price action due to additional market fluctuations. Given the current bearish momentum and inability to enter a short position, it may be best to stay flat and observe until the next clear setup arises.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- Current trend is bearish with potential for further downside movement.\n- The market is not suitable for entering a position at this moment due to the inability to short.\n\nI will output the result to indicate the current conclusion of the analysis.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
