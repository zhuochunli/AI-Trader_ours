Selling all 10 shares is not recommended as we can hold and see if momentum changes.\n\n- **Buy Scenario:**\n  - If price stabilizes and starts to show a bullish reversal (closing above $270), this could be an opportunity to increase positions.\n\n- **Hold Scenario:**\n  - Given the cash position available and existing shares, holding could be a viable option to wait for price action to confirm a trend.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current market conditions, it's best to hold the position and evaluate any potential bounce. We will wait for more favorable price action before making a decision to sell or buy any additional shares. \n\nLet's summarize the actions:\n- No immediate buy or sell recommendation.\n- Hold current position of 10 shares.\n\nSince further analysis or updates might be necessary as the market develops, I will finalize my analysis here.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
