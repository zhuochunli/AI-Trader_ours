The strategy would be to monitor for a break above $274.80 to either take profits or increase position size if cash becomes available.\n\n4. **Sell Strategy:**\n   - Selling a portion to lock in profits could be considered if we see a decline below $273.00 or a close around that level, suggesting potential weakness.\n\n### Proposed Action\n- Given the overall upward momentum and current position status, my proposal is to **hold** the current position of 37 AAPL shares and wait for clearer signals regarding resistance at $274.80.\n\nIf no changes are made now, ideally, you should set alerts for further price movements, especially around key support and resistance levels.\n\n### Final Decision\nI will finalize the strategy to hold the current position and monitor for price action updates.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
