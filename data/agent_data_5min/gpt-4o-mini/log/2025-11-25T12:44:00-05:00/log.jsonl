With only $412.95 available, I can reconsider the amount or adjust the entry strategy.\n\nSince volatility is already high, we must maintain caution. Thus, I suggest holding the current position without adding more due to cash constraints.\n\n### Summary:\n- Current position remains unchanged:   \n   - **CASH**: $412.95  \n   - **QQQ**: 16 shares    \n\n### Final Note:\nFor now, I will not enter any further trades until more favorable cash conditions arise or until the current positions can be adjusted. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
