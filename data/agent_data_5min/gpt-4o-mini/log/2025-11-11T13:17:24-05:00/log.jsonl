However, I have very limited cash on hand, which may restrict potential actions.\n   - The next logical purchase is to buy one additional share of AAPL. This would allow me to benefit from further price increases.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- **Buy 1 Share of AAPL**:\n   - **Price of AAPL**: $274.22\n   - **Total Cost**: $274.22\n   - **Remaining Cash After Transaction**: $21.19 - $274.22 = Not Possible (insufficient cash)\n\nSince I cannot buy more shares due to insufficient cash, my decision is to hold the current position.\n\nI will proceed with an output to indicate the end of this analysis since no transactions can be made. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
