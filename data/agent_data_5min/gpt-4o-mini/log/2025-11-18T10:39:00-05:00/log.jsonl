{"signature": "gpt-4o-mini", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the action to take. Given that I hold zero shares of QQQ, I cannot sell short. In this context, it means I still need to buy the shares to create an initial position. However, I do not have sufficient funds to buy a significant number of shares as per the initial strategy. \n\n### Revised Trade Position\nGiven my cash situation, here are the new proposals:\n\n1. **Stay Flat:** Given the current market structure and my inability to enter a trade due to cash constraints, it may be prudent to hold off on any trading activity until more favorable conditions arise. \n2. **Monitor the Position:** Continue to analyze price movements and volume in the upcoming 5-15 minute intervals for a potential entry when conditions allow.\n\nSince staying flat is advisable now, I will not execute any trades at this moment.\n\n### Conclusion\nDue to insufficient funds and zero shares available for short selling, I will maintain my current cash position while monitoring the market for potential future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
