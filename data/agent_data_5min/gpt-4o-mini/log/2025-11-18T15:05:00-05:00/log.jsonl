A breakout above $601.50 would provide a clear signal to capitalize on upward momentum, with plausible take-profit levels set at prior resistance. Given the solid volume during upward movements, the likelihood of further upward movement is increased.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will proceed to enter this trade position. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
