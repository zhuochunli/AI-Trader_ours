Here's the updated trade setup:\n\n- **Direction:** Long\n- **Entry Price:** $604.00\n- **Stop Loss Price:** $601.50\n- **Take Profit Price:** $608.00\n- **Shares to Buy:** 0 shares (as cash is insufficient)\n\n#### Adjusted Positioning\nWith the available cash, I cannot execute a long position at this time without exceeding the cash limit.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the insufficient capital to execute a trade successfully, I will recommend tracking QQQ closely for a potential return to higher cash levels or consider a different trading approach that aligns with cash availability.\n\nIf you would like to take action or change strategies, please let me know!\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
