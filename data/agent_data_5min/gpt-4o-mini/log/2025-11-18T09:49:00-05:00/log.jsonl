The downward movement has respected recently tested support levels around $598.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Market Structure\n- **Current Market Structure:** The market structure is demonstrating a bearish trend with potential for consolidation around the $598 level. The high volume on the last price drop suggests strong interest in selling off at these prices, reinforcing these bearish sentiments.\n  \n### Step 3: Suggest One Trade\n- **Direction:** Short\n- **Entry Price:** $598.30 (slightly below the recent low)\n- **Stop Loss Price:** $601.50 (to limit losses beyond recent highs)\n- **Take Profit Price:** $594.00 (a reasonable target for a continuation of the bearish trend)\n\n### Step 4: Rationale\nEntering a short position at $598.30 targets further downside based on recent momentum and support/resistance analysis. High volume combined with the drop indicates potential for continued downward movement.\n\nNext, I will initiate the trade."}}
