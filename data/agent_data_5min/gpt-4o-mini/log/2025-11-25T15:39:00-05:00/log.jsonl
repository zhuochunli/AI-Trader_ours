The previous closing price was at $605.19, and given the current price of $609, the breakout above this level further supports bullish sentiment.\n\n### Step 3: Suggest One Trade\n\n- **Direction**: Long\n- **Entry Price**: $609.00\n- **Stop Loss Price**: $606.00 (support level just below current price)\n- **Take Profit Price**: $612.00 (targeting a reasonable resistance level above current price)\n\n### Step 4: Rationale\n\n- The price has clearly broken out to new highs with strong volume, indicating bullish momentum. The selected stop loss provides a cushion against minor pullbacks while allowing for potential further gains with an attractive risk-reward ratio.\n\nLet's proceed with the trade execution for QQQ."}}
