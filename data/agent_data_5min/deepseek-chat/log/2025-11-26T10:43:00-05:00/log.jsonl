The lower highs pattern and rejection at resistance levels indicate potential for further downside to test today's lows around $610.50.\n\n**Note:** Since we already have a short position, no new trade entry is needed. The current position aligns with the bearish technical setup.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
