The risk/reward for additional buying at current levels is not optimal given the portfolio concentration.\n\nThe stock appears to be consolidating around the $272.50-$273.00 range, which could provide a better entry point if it holds as support, but with the current heavy allocation, maintaining the position is prudent.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
