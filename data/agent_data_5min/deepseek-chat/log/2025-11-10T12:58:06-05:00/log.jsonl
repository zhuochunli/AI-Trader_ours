However, it has since declined to $269.70, indicating a pullback from the highs.\n\n2. **Volume Analysis**: \n   - High volume during the morning rally (27,077-27,907 shares)\n   - Lower volume during the afternoon decline (2,658-16,850 shares)\n   - This suggests the selling pressure is not as strong as the buying pressure earlier\n\n3. **Support/Resistance Levels**:\n   - Resistance: $273.57 (today's high)\n   - Support: $268.43 (yesterday's close), $268.52 (today's low so far)\n\n4. **Momentum Indicators**:\n   - The stock is currently trading above yesterday's close ($268.43)\n   - Recent bars show consolidation around $269.15-$269.70 range\n   - The pullback from $273.57 to current levels represents a ~1.4% decline\n\n**Portfolio Considerations:**\n- Current position: 35 shares worth ~$9,439.50\n- Available cash: $573.60\n- The stock is showing resilience by holding above yesterday's close\n\n**Trading Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the technical setup:\n- The stock has pulled back from morning highs but remains above key support\n- Volume patterns suggest the selling pressure is moderate\n- Current price is still above yesterday's close, indicating overall bullish sentiment\n\nI recommend **HOLDING** the current position. The stock appears to be consolidating after the morning rally, and there's no clear technical signal to sell at this point. The risk/reward favors maintaining the position as the stock remains above key support levels.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
