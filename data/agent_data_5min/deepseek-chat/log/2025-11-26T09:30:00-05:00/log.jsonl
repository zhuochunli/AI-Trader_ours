Market just opened and current price data is unavailable\n2. You already have a long position from yesterday\n3. Yesterday showed strong bullish momentum closing near highs\n4. Current cash position is very limited ($136.94)\n\nI recommend **HOLDING** your current position and waiting for market data to develop. The limited cash prevents any meaningful additional position sizing.\n\n**Trade Setup (if data becomes available):**\n- **Direction**: Long (already positioned)\n- **Entry**: Already entered at yesterday's levels\n- **Stop Loss**: $606.00 (below yesterday's consolidation)\n- **Take Profit**: $611.00 (above yesterday's high)\n- **Rationale**: Yesterday's strong close and uptrend momentum suggest continuation, but need current price confirmation\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
