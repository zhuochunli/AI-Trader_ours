We currently hold 20 shares with an average cost likely around yesterday's close of $268.43\n2. Current price of $268.82 represents a small gain of $0.39 per share\n3. The stock is in consolidation mode after a morning rally - better to wait for clearer direction\n4. Transaction costs would eat into the small profit if we sell now\n5. The broader trend from yesterday's close to today's high remains positive\n\nGiven the current technical setup and our small position size, the optimal strategy is to hold and monitor for a clearer breakout direction from the current consolidation range.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
