{"signature": "deepseek-chat", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "There seems to be an issue with the position data. Let me analyze the situation:\n\nThe current position shows 16 shares of QQQ, but the system indicates insufficient shares. This could be due to:\n1. Position data inconsistency\n2. T+1 settlement rules\n3. System error\n\nGiven the bearish market structure and breakdown below $595 support, the prudent action would be to stay flat until the position issue is resolved.\n\n**Recommendation**: Stay flat due to position data inconsistency. The bearish breakdown below $595 with high volume suggests continued downside pressure, but without clear position status, it's better to avoid trading.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
