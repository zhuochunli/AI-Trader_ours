The stock is only slightly above yesterday's close\n2. Current price is near support levels\n3. Limited time remaining in trading session reduces opportunity for significant moves\n4. The small position size (20 shares) doesn't warrant immediate action\n5. Cash position of $4,619.32 provides flexibility for future trades\n\nThe risk/reward profile doesn't justify adding to the position at current levels, nor does it warrant selling given the proximity to support.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
