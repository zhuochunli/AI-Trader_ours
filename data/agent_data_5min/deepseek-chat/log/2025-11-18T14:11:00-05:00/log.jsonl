QQQ opened at $593.09 and initially rallied to $598.77, but has since pulled back to current price of $600.295. The stock is trading below yesterday's close of $603.50.\n\n**15-minute trend**: The broader trend shows QQQ struggling to maintain momentum above $600, with multiple failed attempts to break higher.\n\n## Step 2: Market Structure Analysis\n\n**Current Market Structure**: \n- **Consolidation pattern**: QQQ has been trading in a tight range between $599.35 and $601.46 over the last several bars\n- **Volume pattern**: Volume has been declining during the consolidation, suggesting decreasing conviction\n- **Key levels**: \n  - Resistance: $601.50-$602.00 (multiple failed attempts)\n  - Support: $599.35 (recent low)\n\n**Potential Setup**: Mean-reversion setup appears more likely than breakout given the tight range and lack of volume expansion on recent up moves.\n\n## Step 3: Trade Recommendation\n\n**Direction**: Short\n**Entry price**: $600.30\n**Stop loss price**: $601.60\n**Take profit price**: $598.50\n\n## Step 4: Rationale\n\nThe stock is showing signs of exhaustion near the $601 resistance level with declining volume and multiple failed breakout attempts.
