The stock is testing resistance at $608.41 with momentum building, suggesting potential breakout continuation.\n\nHowever, since we already hold 16 shares of QQQ and the position is profitable, I'll maintain the current position rather than adding more exposure at this resistance level.\n\n**Current Position Management**:\n- Hold existing 16 shares of QQQ\n- Monitor for breakout above $608.41 for potential profit taking\n- Consider selling if price fails to break resistance and reverses below $606.20\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
