Given the bearish setup but inability to short, the appropriate action is to stay flat.\n\n## Final Recommendation: STAY FLAT\n\n**Rationale:** The technical analysis shows a clear downtrend with bearish volume patterns, but since short selling is not available in this simulation and the trend is downward, the best risk management approach is to remain in cash and wait for a better long setup or trend reversal confirmation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
