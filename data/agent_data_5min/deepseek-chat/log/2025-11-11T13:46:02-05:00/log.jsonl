The stock appears to be in a bullish trend with good support levels established.\n\nHowever, since we're near resistance levels and the stock has already moved significantly today, we might consider taking partial profits if we see signs of reversal.\n\n**Position Update Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, I'll maintain the current position of 20 shares. The upward trend remains intact, and there's no clear reversal signal yet.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
