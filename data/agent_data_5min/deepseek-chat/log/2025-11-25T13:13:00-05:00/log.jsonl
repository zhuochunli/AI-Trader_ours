Let me provide a final analysis:\n\n## Final Analysis & Trade Rationale\n\n**Market Structure**: QQQ has completed a strong intraday recovery from morning lows but is now facing resistance near $608 with declining volume, suggesting the upward momentum may be exhausting.\n\n**Trade Execution**:\n- **Action**: Closed long position (sold 15 shares of QQQ)\n- **Entry**: $607.04 (approximate current price)\n- **Result**: Position closed, cash balance now $10,125.67\n\n**Rationale**: The stock has reached a key resistance level after a significant intraday move, and the declining volume during consolidation suggests potential for a pullback. Taking profits here is prudent given the extended move from morning lows.\n\n**Current Status**: Flat position, ready for next opportunity.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
