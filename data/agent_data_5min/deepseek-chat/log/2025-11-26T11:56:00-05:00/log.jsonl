Here's why:\n\n- Current position is already profitable (bought lower, now at $615.66)\n- Market is in consolidation, not showing clear breakout signals\n- Volume patterns suggest waiting for clearer direction\n- Risk-reward for new entry is not optimal at current levels\n\n## Step 4: Position Management\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Direction: Long\n- Entry: Average around $609.335 (yesterday's close)\n- Current Profit: ~$6.33 per share ($44.31 total)\n\n**Recommendation:** Hold current position and monitor for exit signals around resistance levels or if trend reverses.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
