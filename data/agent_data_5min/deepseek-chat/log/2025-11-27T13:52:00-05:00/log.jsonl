The system requires current 5-minute bar data to analyze trends, market structure, and identify potential trade setups.\n\n**Current Position Status:**\n- Cash: $3,790.28\n- QQQ Shares: 10 (long position)\n\n**Recommendation:**\nWithout current market data, it would be irresponsible to suggest any trades. The analysis requires real-time price action, volume patterns, and trend analysis that are currently unavailable.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
