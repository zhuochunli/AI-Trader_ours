{"signature": "deepseek-chat", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the error message, it appears there's only $359.97 available cash, which suggests positions may have changed. Let me adjust the trade size:\n\n- **Direction**: Long\n- **Entry price**: $615.02 (current price)\n- **Stop loss**: $614.20\n- **Take profit**: $616.50\n- **Shares**: 0 (insufficient cash for meaningful position)\n\n**Revised Analysis:**\nGiven the extremely limited cash available ($359.97), I cannot establish a meaningful position in QQQ. The analysis remains valid - QQQ is in a strong bullish trend with recent breakout above $614.50 resistance, but the portfolio lacks sufficient capital for execution.\n\n**Recommendation:** Stay flat due to insufficient capital for meaningful position sizing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
