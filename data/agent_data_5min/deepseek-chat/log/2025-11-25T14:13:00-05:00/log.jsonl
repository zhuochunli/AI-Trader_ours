The consolidation pattern suggests either continuation higher or a pullback. Given our existing long position and the upward bias, it's prudent to hold with a tight stop to protect profits.\n\n## Step 4: No New Trade Recommended\n\n**Decision:** Stay with current position\n- No new entry at this time\n- Monitor for breakout above $608.50 or breakdown below $606.00\n- Consider taking profits if resistance at $609.00 holds\n\nThe current setup doesn't present a clear new entry opportunity given the consolidation pattern and our existing long exposure.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
