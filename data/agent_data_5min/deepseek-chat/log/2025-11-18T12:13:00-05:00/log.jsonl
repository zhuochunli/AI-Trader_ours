QQQ trading below yesterday's close with weak momentum\n2. Resistance at $598-599 level appears strong\n3. The recovery from $591.50 lows lacks conviction with moderate volume\n4. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer directional signals\n\nThe portfolio is now flat with $9,928.82 in cash, ready for new opportunities when clearer setups emerge.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
