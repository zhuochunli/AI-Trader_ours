The current consolidation around $606-607 suggests potential for either continuation higher or a pullback. Given the uncertainty and the fact we're approaching midday, staying flat is prudent.\n\n**Next Steps:** Monitor for either a breakout above $608.41 or a breakdown below $605.00 for the next trading opportunity.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
