The technical setup suggests:\n- The uptrend is intact\n- Volume supports the price movement\n- No clear reversal signals yet\n\nHowever, I cannot access additional historical data for today to perform more comprehensive analysis. The available data shows only the first two 5-minute bars, which is insufficient for making definitive trading decisions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
