Let me recalculate with a smaller position size:\n\n**Revised Position Sizing:**\n- Available cash: $347.01 (from error message)\n- Maximum shares: floor(347.01 / 615.30) = 0 shares\n\n**Updated Recommendation:**\nGiven the insufficient cash for a meaningful position, I recommend staying flat at this time. The market structure analysis remains valid, but position sizing constraints prevent execution.\n\n**Market Analysis Summary:**\n- QQQ is in a bullish consolidation phase near session highs\n- Trading range: $614.30-$615.34\n- Volume declining, suggesting potential breakout\n- Key support at $614.20, resistance at $615.34\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
