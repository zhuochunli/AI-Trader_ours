The stock is holding near session highs with limited selling pressure.\n\n**Trade Setup:**\n- **Direction**: Long\n- **Entry Price**: $614.35 (current level)\n- **Stop Loss**: $613.80 (below recent support)\n- **Take Profit**: $615.20 (above resistance)\n\n## Step 4: Rationale\n\nThe stock is consolidating near session highs with declining volume, suggesting a potential breakout continuation. The tight range and holding above $614 support indicates bullish momentum building for a move toward $615 resistance.\n\n**Current Position Management:**\nYou currently hold 16 shares of QQQ at $614.31. Given the tight consolidation and potential for a small breakout, I recommend holding the position with the same stop loss at $613.80.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
