The stock is trading near support levels and there's no clear directional bias. The small position size (20 shares) provides flexibility to wait for clearer signals.\n\nThe analysis suggests waiting for either:\n1. A clear break above $270 with volume confirmation to consider adding\n2. A break below $268.50 with volume to consider reducing exposure\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
