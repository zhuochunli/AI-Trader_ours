Here's why:\n\n- **Current Price**: $596.37 is in the middle of the consolidation range\n- **Volatility**: Moderate volatility with no clear directional bias\n- **Risk/Reward**: Poor risk/reward ratio for new entries at current levels\n- **Better Entry**: Wait for either break above $598.50 or rejection at resistance\n\n## Step 4: Rationale\n\nThe market is currently in a consolidation phase after a morning decline. With price in the middle of the range and no clear directional bias, the risk of entering at current levels outweighs potential rewards. Better to wait for a clearer breakout or breakdown signal with supporting volume.\n\n**Recommendation: Stay Flat**\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
