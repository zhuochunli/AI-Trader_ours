Let me proceed with the analysis and trading recommendation:\n\n## Final Analysis\n\n**Market Assessment:**\n- Strong downtrend in progress\n- High volume on decline suggests institutional selling\n- No immediate reversal signals\n- Risk of further downside\n\n**Trading Recommendation:**\nGiven the current market conditions and position constraints, I recommend:\n\n1. **Stay flat** on new positions due to extreme volatility\n2. **Monitor for potential short opportunities** if price rallies to resistance around $595-596\n3. **Wait for stabilization** before considering long positions\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Current volatility is high, making risk management challenging\n- Transaction costs would be significant in this environment\n- Liquidity appears adequate but volatility is extreme\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
