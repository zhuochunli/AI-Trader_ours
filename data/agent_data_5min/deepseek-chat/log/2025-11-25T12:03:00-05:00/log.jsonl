The morning recovery from $597.91 to $604.71 represents a significant move, and with volume declining on the recent up bars, there's a high probability of consolidation or pullback from the $605 resistance zone.\n\n**Next Potential Setup:**\nWait for either:\n1. Break above $605.50 with volume confirmation for re-entry long\n2. Pullback to $600-601 support zone for potential long entry\n3. Breakdown below $597.91 for potential short opportunity\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
